## Installation

To start the application, it's necessary first to set up the environment variables in the config directory:

```pwsh
$ cp env/local.env.example env/local.env
```

Remember to use the correct version of Node.js, for which I recommend using nvm with the .nvmrc file.
```pwsh
$ nvm use|install
```
Depending on whether we already have the version, we will use use or install

Next, we must install the modules:
```pwsh
$ npm i
```
## Usage

```pwsh
$ npm start
```

## Features

- Retrieval of Azure functions logs
